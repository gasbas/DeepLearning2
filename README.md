# Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Deep Belief Networks, Deep Neural Networks

Project of the course *Deep Learning 2* of the *M2 Data Science* at  *Institut Polytechnique de Paris*. We were asked to build Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Deep Belief Network and Deep Neural Networks from scratch, and to analyze the results on Binary Alpha Digits and MNIST datasets. 

Our implementation uses Pytorch and benefits from fast matrix multiplication on GPU.
